1. Next.js: All files will be using Next.js, a React framework for building JavaScript applications.

2. React: Both "index.js" and "ToggleButton.js" will use React for creating the user interface components.

3. ToggleButton Component: This component will be exported from "ToggleButton.js" and imported in "index.js" to be used in the main page.

4. CSS Module: "globals.css" will be imported in "index.js" to apply global styles to the website.

5. DOM Element ID: An ID for the button element (e.g., "toggleButton") will be used in "ToggleButton.js" for event handling and in "globals.css" for styling.

6. Event Handler Function: A function (e.g., "handleToggle") will be defined in "ToggleButton.js" to handle the click event on the button. This function will toggle the background color of the website.

7. State Variable: A state variable (e.g., "isRed") will be used in "index.js" to keep track of the current background color. This state will be toggled by the "handleToggle" function.

8. CSS Classes: CSS classes (e.g., "redBackground" and "whiteBackground") will be defined in "globals.css" and used in "index.js" to change the background color of the website.
